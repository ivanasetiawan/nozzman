HISTORY

Looking back,
He's been drawing since forever, he mentioned how he drew on telephone notebook since when he was a kid - but really picked it up around 10 years ago then evolves till now.
It used to be more crocked and weird - anatomically incorrect(arms coming out of head), but now it's more plastic and curvy.

His works evolves during the years - he admits that his artworks now is more curvy
he always wants to try new stuff
old work => anatomically more incorrect - weird


HISTORY
Too much artful for art sake
Stopped half way because it wash't commercial enough for him. Which he love doing more noe than then
He always wanted to reach audience because he knew how fun would it be because he used to be playing in a band.

One of the main thing is he was too young - too i

art school really force you to broad your verizon. What he felt was too much theory, too much in crowd. However if he could he would love to get the techniques down. One of the reasons to go back to art school - start what you finish. He would love to see whats gonna happen if he did.
What he's doing is actually a good balance for him.


CLIENTÃ¥

For client works he always keep it fixed as in it needs to be the certain style the client requested(particular comic style).
Drawing book is very precious to him. It is his escape of freak out on diff styles force himself to not judge - just go not to sketch just go with shape - constantly evolves. enforce him to try new stuff.For the more commecrial illustrator - He has certain style, more simplistic style
Simple shapes help to tell a story

Commercially => simplistic style(newspaper - editorial)
simple shapes help to tell stories. Cartoon styles always implicate that it's funny.
He loves to show humour in it - get a bit a smile out of it.
Drawing => funny // storyline => serious(visual ironic joke)

First commercial client was a new magazine called DVD valley(which later on changed to Film valley) => cartoon about movies. 2003. at that time he did cartoon for a year. Back then there was no serious competition, because at that time most of the old cartoon makers didn't have webs and they didn't want to share their art online(copyright infringement)/they didn't want their art to be on forum. I was on the other side - he wanted to share his stuff that's why people picked it up.


INSPIRATION


VISION



Now you handle big clients

He did a lot of free stuff and still for some projects he likes. Example big music website called Kindamuzik - good exercise for him because he can do whatever.

He never approached clients - he believes that good websites and portfolio works speak for itself although he can understand that nowadays it is pretty hard.
In the beginning - the whole new wave kinda freaked artists out. But in the end of the day the real pro clients always look for professional arts.

Lately he got international clients from dribble.

he is never not inspired. The thing is forcing himself to start / nothing to do with inspirations. never blank. Drawing books is really help. not to think - just draw.
Sometimes half way he begins to see what he's making => creative flow.
start drawing the tree and see the flow.

Freedom not to exclude anything.

One image => one BOOM and that's it. Inspiration is overrated. It gives you an excuse to do nothing. Just get to it!
You just have to do in an active state.


COLLABORATION!
Bram loves to shape and reshape.

Favorite artists! Pop surrealism.
Garry Baseman, Todd Hesseldon, Femke Hiemstra, her techniques on oil painting is awesome. He's not really a perfectionist type of a guy.


A way to be creative




Visit a lot of musea
travelling -> local talents in Paris
Book? make your own books!

Movies can be a really good inspirations, sometimes after watching a movie

What inspires him> Disney Pixar movies for example. Making off sections on DVD => interested in the process behind it - real labour behind it.
Documentaries.

Robert Crumb => Crumb. He is really good because he draws so much.
