					<h2>History</h2>
					<p class="startline"><span class="letter">L</span>ooking back, Bram has always been creative as a kid, he has been drawing for as long as he can remember (telephone notebook was his creative canvas); however he (finally) really picked it up around 10 years ago then evolves until now.
					<!-- This part of interview was very interesting for me because I got to know --></p>

					<h3>How it started</h3>

					<p>As most artists, Bram started his artistic path at an art school (St. Joost in Breda) but decided to drop out because it was not commercial enough for him at that time. In the beginning he always wanted to reach the audience right away to experience the feedback, which was something he really enjoyed for being in a band.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<span class="icon-left-quote"></span>Art school really forces you to broad your verizon but it was too much theory, too much in crowd...<span class="icon-right-quote"></span>
					</blockquote>

					<p>As a change, he decided to jump into the field right away by putting his works online. At that time there was no serious competition online because most of the well known cartoonists did not have websites to represent their works yet; not only that, they did not feel too comfortable sharing their arts online (copyright infringement). That period gave Bram a good breathing space to explore the online world; in fact, he got his first commercial client called DVD Valley (which is now called Film Valley) approximately a year after that.</p>

					<blockquote class="alt"><span class="icon-left-quote"></span>I think my problem was because I was too young.. I thought it was too much artful for art sake.<span class="icon-right-quote"></span></blockquote>

					<p>Intrigue by his story, I asked if he ever regretted not finishing his art degree. Admittedly, he has a minor regret for it; he would love to get the techniques down, to finish what he started and to see what would happen if he did. However, he (still) believes that what he's doing is actually a good balance for him. He acknowledges his passion was shifting throughout the years, he loves doing artsy projects more now than then.</p>

						<h2>Style</h2>

						<p><span class="letter">R</span>egarding style, Bram realizes that it evolves throughout the year. "It used to be crocked and weird; anatomically incorrect.. Like arms coming out of head. These days they are more curvy", he explained.</p>

						<p>For client works he always keep it fixed because it needs to be the certain style the client requested (particular comic style). They mostly have simplistic style because simple shapes help to tell stories. As an example, cartoon styles always implicate a funny message, it indicates humour yet the storyline can be a serious topic.</p>

						<h2>Inspirations</h2>

						<p><span class="letter">F</span>inding inspirations is never an issue for Bram; in fact, he is never not inspired. The only thing that could get in the way is laziness and that has nothing to do with an artist's active state. One of the reasons can be the amount of hours he invests on his drawing books</p>

						<p>Drawing book is very precious to him. It is his escape of freak out on diff styles force himself to not judge - just go not to sketch just go with shape - constantly evolves. enforce him to try new stuff.</p>

						<p>There are many ways to train your imaginations, such as:
							a. Going to several musea. His favorite city is Paris, he loves going to several local artists' exhibitions)
							b. Creating your own books. His favorite artist is Robert Crumb.
							c. Movies such as Disney Pixar can ve a very good source of inspirations.Movies can be a really good inspirations, sometimes after watching a movie
							<!-- What inspires him> Disney Pixar movies for example. Making off sections on DVD => interested in the process behind it - real labour behind it.
Documentaries. -->
						</p>

						<blockquote><span class="icon-left-quote"></span>Inspiration is overrated. It gives you an excuse to do nothing. The key is just get to it!<span class="icon-right-quote"></span></blockquote>

						<h3>Collaborations</h3>
						<p>Bram loves to create shapes and reshapes on top of them. </p>
