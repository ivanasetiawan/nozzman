					<h2>History</h2>
					<div class="columns">
						<p><span class="letter">L</span>ooking back, Bram has been drawing for as long as he can remember. He used to draw on telephone notebook since when he was a kid, but really picked it up around 10 years ago then evolves until now. </p>
						<p>As most artists, Bram also started his artistic path at an art school but decided to drop out because it was not commercial enough for him at that time. In the beginning he always wanted to reach the audience because he knew how fun it would be based on his experience in a band.</p>
						<blockquote>"Art school really forces you to broad your verizon but it was too much theory, too much in crowd..."</blockquote>However if he could he would love to get the techniques down. However he also have his minor regret for not finishing it, one of the main things is because he was too young at that time.One of the reasons to go back to art school - start what you finish. He would love to see whats gonna happen if he did.</p>
						<p>First commercial client was a new magazine called DVD valley(which later on changed to Film valley) => cartoon about movies. 2003. at that time he did cartoon for a year. Back then there was no serious competition, because at that time most of the old cartoon makers didn't have webs and they didn't want to share their art online(copyright infringement)/they didn't want their art to be on forum. I was on the other side - he wanted to share his stuff that's why people picked it up.</p>

						<h2>Style</h2>
						<p><span class="letter">R</span>egarding style, Bram realizes that it evolves throughout the year. "It used to be crocked and weird; anatomically incorrect.. Like arms coming out of head", he explained. However for client works he always keep it fixed as in it needs to be the certain style the client requested(particular comic style for example).</p>
						<p>Commercially => simplistic style(newspaper - editorial)
						simple shapes help to tell stories. Cartoon styles always implicate that it's funny.
						He loves to show humour in it - get a bit a smile out of it.Drawing => funny // storyline => serious(visual ironic joke)</p>

						<h2>Inspirations</h2>
						<p><span class="letter">D</span>rawing book is very precious to him. It is his escape of freak out on diff styles force himself to not judge - just go not to sketch just go with shape - constantly evolves. enforce him to try new stuff.</p>
