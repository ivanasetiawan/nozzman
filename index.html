				<h2>History</h2>
				<div class="columns">
					<p class="with-letter"><span class="letter">L</span>ooking back, Bram has been drawing for as long as he can remember. He used to draw on telephone notebook since when he was a kid, but really picked it up around 10 years ago then evolves until now. </p>
					<p>As most artists, Bram also started his artistic path at an art school but decided to drop out because it was not commercial enough for him at that time. In the beginning he always wanted to reach the audience because he knew how fun it would be based on his experience in a band.</p>
					<p>"Art school really forces you to broad your verizon but it was too much theory, too much in crowd..." However if he could he would love to get the techniques down. However he also have his minor regret for not finishing it, one of the main things is because he was too young at that time.One of the reasons to go back to art school - start what you finish. He would love to see whats gonna happen if he did.</p>
